# actfast3
This repository holds analytic code for the ACTFAST3 trial

Data is located at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02830126 and copied into the /data folder.
Note that there are two "eras" of data: pre-epic and epic, as well as a merged file.

The Rmd file contains the main analysis; a comment on the first line describes the intended docker invocation.
